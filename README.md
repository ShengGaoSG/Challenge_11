# Forecasting Net Prophet
---
In this Challenge, I am playing the role of analyst at MercadoLibre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I will analyze the company's financial and user data to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

This Jupyter notebook contains the following:
- Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.
- An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.
- A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.
- Answers to questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter Notebook.
- A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.
